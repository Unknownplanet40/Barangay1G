                                    The City of Imus is the de facto capital of
                                    the Province of Cavite. Under the
                                    Recollects, it became an independent
                                    municipality in 1975. In October 2009,
                                    Republic Act 9727 reapportioned Cavite into
                                    seven districts making Imus the Third
                                    Legislative District. On 12 April 2012,
                                    Republic Act 10161 was enacted into law,
                                    converting the Municipality of Imus into a
                                    City. The people of Imus ratified this later
                                    on through a plebiscite on 30 June 2012. The
                                    city's rich history is evident in its
                                    various heritage sites--the Imus Cathedral,
                                    Imus City Plaza, and Imus Heritage Site. It
                                    was also the site of two momentous
                                    Katipunero victories during the Philippine
                                    Revolution against Spain--The Battle of Imus
                                    and the Battle of Alapan, where the first
                                    Philippine flag was unfurled and raised,
                                    making Imus the "Flag Capital of the
                                    Philippines".
